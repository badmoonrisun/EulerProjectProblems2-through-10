Euler Project Problem 006

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, [picture] 385.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, [picture] 3025.

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is [picture] 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
